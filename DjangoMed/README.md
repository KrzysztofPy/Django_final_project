The DjangoMED application allows for multiple users to log into the webpage and book varius doctor visits. 
The unique functionality with this application is that each user can swap their visit with another user (rotation). If user_1 decides to post his/her visit for SWAP then it is visible for all other users. If user_2 decides that he/she want's to swap their visit with user_1 then he/she can ask for that action. Then user_1 can see that there is an option for SWAP and can APPROVE or DECLINE it. Respective action will take action in the database.
